[Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev) is “a modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have.”
It was created by 37signals as an alternative to heavier approaches
to client-side interactions.

This is an experimental library that lets you write Stimulus controllers
using ClojureScript.
